4simpleproblems (4sp)
this is the repo for the 4simpleproblems website. it's basically just a place with a bunch of tools and features for students to waste time.

the live site is at: 4simpleproblems.github.io

v4 features
here's all the stuff that was added in version 4.

login stuff
there's a real signup and login system now. you have to make an account to use most of the site, otherwise you can't save anything.

the logged-in ui
once you're logged in, there's a sidebar on every page so you can get around faster. it has shortcuts to all the tools. it also shows your username and email scrolling at the top in a marquee effect.

personal dashboard
this is the main page you see after you log in. it has a few widgets.

weather: tells u the weather. pretty straightforward.

clock & timer: a clock so you know the time, and a timer you can use for whatever.

high-precision countdowns
this is its own app on the site. you can make a countdown for any future date you want. it's super precise and tracks time down to a tenth of a second, so you can watch the numbers go crazy when it gets close.

notes app
a page for taking notes. you can write and save whatever you want here.

about the limit: just so you know, there's a 750,000 character limit for all of your notes put together. if you hit the limit, you have to delete some old notes before you can save any new ones.

requests page
this is a page where you can tell me what you want.

request sounds: ask for sounds you want on the soundboard.
request features: if you have an idea for a new tool, suggest it here.
report issues: if something is broken or doesn't work right, you can report the bug.

entertainment & utilities
a few things for fun or for getting around school filters.

soundboard: it has a bunch of sounds and a simulated spatial audio feature.
proxies: for private Browse.
gba & browser games: a bunch of classic game boy advance games and other browser games that you can play to kill some time.

advanced account settings
a page to manage your account.

manage your info: you can change your username and password whenever you want.
account deletion: you can also delete your account from here. be careful, this gets rid of everything permanentlyâ€”your notes, your settings, all of it. there's no going back.
