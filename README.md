# Proj-Vanadium (4SP V4)

**Release Date:** August 23rd, 2025  
**Motto:** *Built for more.*

**Proj-Vanadium** is the fourth and most complete version of [4SP (4simpleproblems)](https://github.com/4simpleproblems). After experimenting with design, structure, and features through V1–V3, Vanadium is where it all finally clicks — a cleaner UI, smart tools, deeper personalization, and a more consistent vibe.

Everything is optimized for **desktop-first** use. Most things still *work* on mobile, but you’ll get the best experience with a proper screen.

Accounts are required for most features — because this version is made for people who are actually here to use it. No more just pulling up a page and leaving.

## 🪦 Archived: Proxies Page

Yep, it’s gone.  
The **Proxies page is archived** because I’m broke, bare servers got banned, and I can’t keep pretending it works when it’s offline every other day.

You’ll still find the page, but all it does now is explain why it's gone.  
Maybe it’ll come back if I get rich or find some clever free solution that doesn’t violate 6 TOS pages.

## 💬 Final Note

**Proj-Vanadium** is the most complete version of 4SP so far. It’s not perfect, but it’s consistent, clean, and made for people who care about simplicity with power underneath.

Thanks to everyone who stuck around since V1.  
And if this is your first time here — welcome to the chaos, it's organized now (mostly).
