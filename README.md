# Proj-Vanadium (4SP V4)

**Release Date:** August 23rd, 2025  
**Tagline:** *Built for more. Not built perfect.*

**Proj-Vanadium** is the fourth major version of [4SP (4simpleproblems)](https://github.com/4simpleproblems), and easily the biggest update it’s ever had. This version was basically a full rebuild — new dashboard, new layout, new tools, and a bunch of stuff I probably should’ve done in earlier versions but didn’t think of until now.

Everything’s been made to feel more solid and usable without turning into a bloated mess. It’s **mostly optimized for desktop**, but parts of it still kinda work on mobile if you're chill with it being a little squished.

Oh, and yeah — the proxies page? That’s **archived** now, because I’m broke and don’t have a job to keep paying for bare servers that go down every 2 days. 💀  
If I ever strike it rich or find a workaround that doesn’t get banned by Koyeb in 10 minutes, maybe I’ll bring it back.

## 🪦 Archived: Proxies Page

Yeah... proxies are **gone for now**.

I tried hosting them with bare servers, but those things died constantly and got banned everywhere. And since I don’t have a job, I couldn’t keep paying for stable ones — so instead of pretending it works, I just archived it.

If you go looking for the proxies page, you'll find a little goodbye note instead.  
RIP to the most unstable feature in 4SP history.

## 📁 Folder Structure (Kinda Simplified)
