            <h3>1. Your Agreement to these Terms</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to 4SP V4 (referred to as "4SP," "the Service," "we," "us," or "our"). 4SP V4 is a general web service, provided as an open-source project intended for educational and entertainment purposes.

If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you are prohibited from using the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Detailed Description of Service</h3>
            <p>
                4SP V4 is a multifaceted public platform designed to be "made for everyone." The Service provides users with access to a variety of tools and features, including but not limited to:

                <li><strong>Soundboard with Explicit Sounds:</strong> A tool allowing users to play various sound clips, which may include sounds of an explicit or mature nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools:</strong> Experimental features that utilize artificial intelligence to generate content or provide assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Proxies:</strong> Utilities designed to route web traffic through our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Messaging System:</strong> A feature that allows for communication between registered users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All tools and information on this website are provided on a strictly "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without any warranties of any kind.</p>

            <h3>3. User Conduct and Absolute Responsibility</h3>
            <p>You are solely and entirely responsible for your own actions and conduct while using the Service. You acknowledge and agree that you bear all risks associated with the use of any feature on this platform.</p>

            <h4>A. Use of Soundboard and Explicit Sounds</h4>
            <p>
                You understand that the soundboard may contain audio clips that are explicit, loud, or otherwise disruptive. You are solely responsible for the context in which you use these sounds. Using the soundboard to harass, annoy, or disrupt others, especially in environments like schools or workplaces, is a misuse of the Service. Any consequences arising from such misuse are your responsibility alone.
            </p>

            <h4>B. Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h4>
            <p>
                The AI features provided are experimental. You acknowledge that content generated by AI can be unpredictable, inaccurate, or potentially offensive. We do not control or endorse the output of the AI. You agree that you will not use the AI for any illegal, harmful, or malicious purposes. Any reliance on or use of AI-generated content is at your own risk.
            </p>

            <h4>C. Use of Web Proxies</h4>
            <p>
                The proxy tools are provided for legitimate purposes only. Using the proxy to bypass security measures, access restricted networks, or engage in illegal activities is strictly prohibited. You acknowledge that attempting to circumvent network policies at institutions like your school or workplace may constitute a serious violation of their rules and could lead to severe disciplinary action.
            </p>

            <h4>D. Use of the Messaging System</h4>
            <p>
                You are entirely responsible for the content of the messages you send. You agree not to send messages that are harassing, defamatory, illegal, or otherwise objectionable. We do not monitor user communications, and we are not liable for any content transmitted by users. You should exercise caution and avoid sharing sensitive personal information.
            </p>

            <div class="disclaimer-box">

            <h2 id="privacy" style="margin-top: 50px;">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 19, 2025</p>

            <h3>1. Your Consent to Our Data Practices</h3>
            <p>
                Your privacy is important, but transparency is paramount. By using 4SP V4, you consent to the data collection and use practices described in this policy. When you create an account, you willingly provide the information necessary for the Service to function and agree to the storage of data generated by your activity.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect and Store</h3>
            <p>
                We utilize <strong>Google Firebase</strong>, a backend platform provided by Google, for our core infrastructure. This includes authentication, hosting, and our primary database solution, <strong>Cloud Firestore</strong>. The data we collect and store includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect and store the information you provide, such as your email address and encrypted password, via Firebase Authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Any data you create or submit is stored in our Cloud Firestore database. This explicitly includes messages sent through the messaging system, saved preferences, or other inputs related to the Service's features.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> Google Firebase may automatically collect certain technical information to provide its services securely and effectively. This can include authentication event logs, user agent strings, IP addresses for session management and security, and general usage analytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How and Why We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>The information collected is used for the following essential purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To create, manage, and secure your user account.</li>
                <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the functionality of the Service, including the storage and retrieval of your data (like messages).</li>
                <li>To monitor the health and security of the Service and to prevent abuse or malicious activity.</li>
                <li>To analyze aggregated, non-identifiable user engagement data to enhance the user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We do not, and will not, sell your personal information to third-party marketers.</strong></p>

             <h3>4. Data Storage and User Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                All user-generated content, including messages, is stored in our Cloud Firestore database. While Firebase provides a secure environment, you acknowledge that because 4SP V4 is an open-source and experimental project, there are inherent risks. You agree that you are solely responsible for the data you create and store, and you hold us harmless for any unauthorized access or loss of this data.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Changes to These Policies</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to update our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policies on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes to remain informed. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
