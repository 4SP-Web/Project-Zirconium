            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 14, 2025</p>

            <h3>1. Your Agreement to these Terms</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to 4SP V4 (referred to as "the Service" or "the project"). This is a personal, non-commercial project created by an individual student for entertainment purposes only. No company or formal organization is associated with this website, and it is offered without any financial gain. By accessing this website, creating an account, or using any of its features, you are confirming that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you are prohibited from using the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Detailed Description of Service</h3>
            <p>
                4SP V4 is a multifaceted public platform designed strictly for <strong>entertainment purposes</strong>. By using the Service, you agree to access and utilize its features solely for personal entertainment. The Service provides users with access to a variety of tools and features, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Games and Emulation:</strong> A selection of web-based games and emulators, including titles such as classic <strong>DOOM</strong>, <strong>Eaglercraft</strong>, <strong>GN-Math Games</strong>, <strong>StrongdogXP</strong>, and emulated <strong>Game Boy</strong> games. You acknowledge that some of these games contain violence, including the use of firearms, and are intended for mature audiences. These games are provided as-is, and 4SP does not claim ownership or copyright over them.</li>
                <li><strong>Soundboard:</strong> An interactive soundboard allowing users to play various sound clips. You acknowledge and agree that this feature may contain <strong>sounds of an explicit or mature nature</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Messaging App:</strong> A downloadable messaging application (HTML file) that runs locally on your computer. You are solely responsible for downloading and running this file. While it connects to the 4SP Firebase backend and is subject to our Privacy Policy, the Service is not liable for any issues arising from its use on your personal device.</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity and Personalization Apps:</strong> A suite of tools to enhance your experience:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Notes:</strong> A versatile note-taking application that offers local saving. You can also save notes in an encrypted format using the CryptoJS library (see Privacy Policy for details).</li>
                        <li><strong>Countdowns & Playlists:</strong> Tools that exclusively use local saving on your device. Your data is not stored on our servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Requests Page:</strong> A feature allowing users to submit requests for new sounds or features. All submissions are subject to the content standards outlined in the User Conduct section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All tools and information on this website are provided on a strictly "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without any warranties of any kind.</p>
            
            <h3>3. User Conduct and Absolute Responsibility</h3>
            <p>You are solely and entirely responsible for your own actions and conduct while using the Service. You acknowledge and agree that you bear all risks associated with the use of any feature on this platform.</p>
            <h4>A. Use of Soundboard and Explicit Sounds</h4>
            <p>
                You understand that the soundboard may contain audio clips that are explicit, loud, or otherwise disruptive. You are solely responsible for the context in which you use these sounds. Using the soundboard to harass, annoy, or disrupt others, especially in environments like schools or workplaces, is a misuse of the Service. Any consequences arising from such misuse are your responsibility alone.
            </p>
            <h4>B. User Submissions and Content Standards</h4>
            <p>
                You agree that you will not submit, post, or transmit any content, requests, or communications that contain <strong>explicit, obscene, offensive, or illegal wording or material</strong>. This includes the public requests page and any other publicly available user-generated text. An explicit exception is made for the <strong>source Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</strong> you provide when requesting a new sound; the URL may link to explicit material, but all accompanying text must remain clean. Violation of this policy may result in the termination of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submitting requests on the <strong>Requests page</strong> constitutes a direct violation if your request contains explicit wording or if your publicly displayed username contains explicit wording. At an administrator's sole discretion, your account may be <strong>temporarily banned</strong> for one (1), three (3), or seven (7) days. Repeat offenders may be banned <strong>indefinitely</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Exception:</strong> You will not be penalized for having an explicit username if you submit requests <strong>anonymously</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Voluntary Donations</h3>
            <p>
                4SP is a personal project funded entirely by the creator. To help cover operational costs such as hosting and domain registration, the project accepts voluntary donations through third-party services. All donations are greatly appreciated but are considered final and are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. Donating does not entitle you to any ownership, special features, or influence over the project.
            </p>
            
            <div class="disclaimer-box">
                <h4>5. Supreme Limitation of Liability and Comprehensive Disclaimer</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>This is a personal, non-commercial student project provided for entertainment only. By creating an account and using this Service, you irrevocably and explicitly understand and agree that I, the sole creator and administrator of 4SP V4, cannot and will not be held liable, responsible, or accountable for any and all repercussions, consequences, damages, or punishments you may face as a result of using this website or any of its features.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This includes, but is absolutely not limited to: academic or workplace disciplinary action; civil or criminal legal trouble; or any personal, social, financial, or emotional distress or harm. By agreeing to these terms, you formally and completely absolve me of any and all responsibility.
                </p>

            <h2 id="privacy" style="margin-top: 50px;">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 14, 2025</p>

            <h3>1. Your Consent to Our Data Practices</h3>
            <p>
                Your privacy is important, but transparency is paramount. By using 4SP V4, you consent to the data collection and use practices described in this policy. When you create an account, you willingly provide the information necessary for the Service to function.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect and Store</h3>
            <p>
                The Service utilizes <strong>Google Firebase</strong> for its core infrastructure. The data collected is strictly limited to what is necessary for account management and functionality:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account & Authentication Information:</strong> Your username, email address, account creation date, and authentication method (e.g., Google, GitHub).</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> The requests you submit on the Requests page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How and Why Your Information Is Used</h3>
            <p>The information collected is used to create and secure your account, operate and maintain the Service, and prevent abuse. <strong>I do not, and will not, sell your personal information to third-party marketers.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>4. Data Storage and User Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                User-generated content (submissions to the Requests page) is stored in the Service's Cloud Firestore database. It is important to distinguish between cloud data and data stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device. Features like <strong>Countdowns</strong> and <strong>Playlists</strong> store data on your computer's browser storage and this data is not transmitted to our servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>Notes app</strong> also saves locally. Additionally, it offers an option to save notes in an <strong>encrypted format</strong> using the industry-standard CryptoJS library. While this feature adds a layer of security, you are solely responsible for managing your encryption password. If you lose your password, your encrypted data cannot be recovered. No encryption is guaranteed to be unbreakable, and the Service provides this feature as-is, without any warranty of security.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Changes to These Policies</h3>
            <p>
                I reserve the right to update these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="copyright" style="margin-top: 50px;">Copyright and Takedown Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 14, 2025</p>

            <p>
                This project respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you are a copyright owner and believe that any content hosted on this Service infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a DMCA notification.
            </p>

            <h3>2. How to Send a Takedown Notice</h3>
