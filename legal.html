            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM Eastern Time (EST)</p>

            <h3>1. Your Agreement to these Terms</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to 4SP V4 (referred to as "the Service" or "the project"). This is a personal, non-commercial project created by an individual student for entertainment purposes only. No company or formal organization is associated with this website, and it is offered without any financial gain. By accessing this website, creating an account, or using any of its features, you are confirming that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you are prohibited from using the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Detailed Description of Service</h3>
            <p>
                4SP V4 is a multifaceted public platform designed strictly for <strong>entertainment purposes</strong>. By using the Service, you agree to access and utilize its features solely for personal entertainment. The Service provides users with access to a variety of tools and features, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Games and Emulation:</strong> A selection of web-based games, including emulated <strong>Game Boy Advance (GBA)</strong> titles for entertainment.</li>
                <li><strong>Soundboard:</strong> An interactive soundboard allowing users to play various sound clips. You acknowledge and agree that this feature may contain <strong>sounds of an explicit or mature nature</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity and Personalization Apps:</strong> A suite of tools to enhance your experience:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Notes:</strong> A versatile note-taking application that offers both private <strong>cloud saving</strong> for access across devices and <strong>local saving</strong> to your personal computer. You can also export your notes to a plain text file according to your preferences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Countdowns:</strong> A straightforward tool for tracking events that exclusively uses <strong>local saving</strong> on your device. Your countdown data is not stored on our servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Playlists:</strong> An application that allows you to save your favorite sounds from the Soundboard. Playlist data is <strong>saved locally</strong> to your device. You can easily import and export your playlists as a JSON file, which uses Base64 encoding, allowing you to share them with others through any communication or mailing service.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All tools and information on this website are provided on a strictly "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without any warranties of any kind.</p>

            <h3>3. User Conduct and Absolute Responsibility</h3>
            <p>You are solely and entirely responsible for your own actions and conduct while using the Service. You acknowledge and agree that you bear all risks associated with the use of any feature on this platform.</p>

            <h4>A. Use of Soundboard and Explicit Sounds</h4>
            <p>
                You understand that the soundboard may contain audio clips that are explicit, loud, or otherwise disruptive. You are solely responsible for the context in which you use these sounds. Using the soundboard to harass, annoy, or disrupt others, especially in environments like schools or workplaces, is a misuse of the Service. Any consequences arising from such misuse are your responsibility alone.
            </p>

            <h4>B. User Submissions and Content Standards</h4>
            <p>
                You agree that you will not submit, post, or transmit any content, requests, or communications that contain <strong>explicit, obscene, offensive, or illegal wording or material</strong>. This includes, but is not limited to, the public requests page for new sounds, reporting issues or requesting new features, and any other user-generated text that is publicly avaliable. An explicit exception is made for the <strong>source Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</strong> you provide when requesting a new sound for the soundboard. The URL may link to the source of the explicit material for the sound clip; however, all accompanying text in your request must remain free of explicit language. Violation of this policy may result in the termination of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, submitting requests on the <strong>Requests page</strong> constitutes a direct violation of these Terms if either of the following conditions is met:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your request contains explicit wording that circumvents our automated censoring systems.</li>
                <li>Your username contains explicit wording and is publicly displayed with your request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Should a violation occur, an administrator will review the incident. At the administrator's sole discretion, your account may be <strong>temporarily banned</strong> from accessing the Service for a period of <strong>one (1), three (3), or seven (7) days</strong>. Repeat offenders who persistently violate these content standards may have their account banned <strong>indefinitely</strong>.
            </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Exception:</strong> You will not be penalized for having a username with explicit wording if you choose to submit your requests <strong>anonymously</strong>, as this prevents your username from being publicly displayed.
            </p>


            <div class="disclaimer-box">
                <h4>4. Supreme Limitation of Liability and Comprehensive Disclaimer</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>This is a personal, non-commercial student project provided for entertainment only. By creating an account and using this Service, you irrevocably and explicitly understand and agree that I, the sole creator and administrator of 4SP V4, cannot and will not be held liable, responsible, or accountable for any and all repercussions, consequences, damages, or punishments you may face as a result of using this website or any of its features.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This comprehensive limitation of liability includes, but is absolutely not limited to:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Any form of academic or institutional punishment, including but not limited to detention, suspension, or expulsion.</li>
                    <li>Any form of workplace disciplinary action, including but not limited to warnings, demotion, or termination of employment.</li>
                    <li>Any civil or criminal legal trouble, charges, or proceedings you may encounter.</li>
                    <li>Any personal, social, financial, or emotional distress or harm.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    By agreeing to these terms, you formally and completely absolve me, the creator of 4SP V4, of any and all responsibility. You acknowledge that your use of the Service is entirely at your own risk, and you agree that under no circumstances shall I be affected, harmed, or punished in any state, way, or form for your actions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="privacy" style="margin-top: 50px;">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM Eastern Time (EST)</p>

            <h3>1. Your Consent to Our Data Practices</h3>
            <p>
                Your privacy is important, but transparency is paramount. By using 4SP V4, you consent to the data collection and use practices described in this policy. When you create an account, you willingly provide the information necessary for the Service to function and agree to the storage of data generated by your activity.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect and Store</h3>
            <p>
                The Service utilizes <strong>Google Firebase</strong>, a backend platform provided by Google, for its core infrastructure. This includes authentication, hosting, and the primary database solution, <strong>Cloud Firestore</strong>. The data collected by the Service includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, the Service collects and stores the information you provide, such as your email address and encrypted password, via Firebase Authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Any data you create or submit, such as saved preferences or other inputs related to the Service's features, is stored in the Cloud Firestore database. This specifically includes notes saved using the "cloud save" feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> Google Firebase may automatically collect certain technical information to provide its services securely and effectively. This can include authentication event logs, user agent strings, IP addresses for session management and security, and general usage analytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How and Why Your Information Is Used</h3>
            <p>The information collected is used for the following essential purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To create, manage, and secure your user account.</li>
                <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the functionality of the Service, including the storage and retrieval of your user-generated data like cloud-saved notes.</li>
                <li>To monitor the health and security of the Service and to prevent abuse or malicious activity.</li>
                <li>To analyze aggregated, non-identifiable user engagement data to enhance the user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>I do not, and will not, sell your personal information to third-party marketers.</strong></p>

                <h3>4. Data Storage and User Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                All user-generated content intended for cloud storage is stored in the Service's Cloud Firestore database. While Firebase provides a secure environment, you acknowledge that because 4SP V4 is an open-source and experimental project, there are inherent risks. You agree that you are solely responsible for the data you create and store, and you hold me harmless for any unauthorized access or loss of this data.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to distinguish between data stored on the Service's cloud infrastructure and data stored <strong>locally</strong> on your own device. Features such as the cloud saving option in the Notes app store your data in our Cloud Firestore database as described above. However, other features like the <strong>Countdowns app</strong>, the <strong>Playlists app</strong>, and the <strong>local saving option in the Notes app</strong> store data directly on your computer's browser storage. This locally stored data is not transmitted to our servers. Furthermore, when you export data, such as a text file from the Notes app or a Base64-encoded JSON file from the Playlists app, you are creating a local copy. You are solely responsible for the management, security, and sharing of these exported files.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Changes to These Policies</h3>
            <p>
                I reserve the right to update these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at any time. I will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policies on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes to remain informed. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM Eastern Time (EST)</p>

            <h3>1. Reporting Copyright Infringement</h3>
            <p>
                This project respects the intellectual property rights of others. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable laws, I have a policy of addressing claims of copyright infringement.
